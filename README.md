<h1> Welcome to Budget Explorer 2020 v1.0</h1>
<h3>A brief about Union Budget 2020</h3>
<p>Every year all the departments of our governemnt creates a budget for the nation. Now there are two parts to it: 
<ul>
<li><b>Receipt Budget:</b> In simple words, the Receipt budget, is about the amount of money government gets from tax revenue, non-tax revenue and capital receipts </li>
<li><b>Expenditure Budget:</b> Expenditure budget is about how governemnt plans to spend the amount of money received from tax revenue, non-tax revenue and capital receipts </li>
</ul>
</p>
This financial year 2020-21 the Receipt Budget and the Expenditure budget amounted for <b>30,42,230 Crores INR.</b>
<h3>Goal of this project</h3>
<p>
 There is a plethora of governemnt data available. But the issue is that they are raw data and are often times not represented properly. <br/>
Hence the common people cannot get the required information or insights in a easy way.
With this project we plan to <b><i>"visualize"</i></b> the available data and draw meaningful insights and showcase everything in a user friendly dashboard. <br/>
 <b>This dashboard showcases meaningful information and insights of the Expenditure Budget of 2020-21
</b>
